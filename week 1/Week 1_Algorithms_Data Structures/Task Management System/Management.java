// 1. A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes, as it only requires updating the pointers of adjacent nodes. However, because each node points only to the next node, traversing the list in reverse or accessing nodes randomly can be less efficient, requiring a linear search from the head of the list.

// 1. A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but with an added complexity: each node contains two referencesâ€”one to the next node and another to the previous node. This bidirectional structure allows for traversal in both directions, making operations like insertion and deletion at both ends of the list more efficient. However, it requires more memory to store the additional pointer, which can lead to slightly increased overhead compared to singly linked lists.

// 3. Linked lists offer several advantages over arrays for dynamic data:

// 3. Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size by adding or
// removing nodes, while arrays have a fixed size and require resizing or
// reallocating memory to accommodate additional elements.

// 3. Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting nodes in a linked
// list is efficient (O(1) for the first or last node, O(n) for specific
// positions) because it involves adjusting pointers rather than shifting
// elements as in arrays.

// 3. Memory Utilization: Linked lists can utilize memory more efficiently by
// allocating memory only as needed for each node, avoiding wasted space
// associated with larger arrays that may be partially filled.

// 3. No Need for Contiguous Memory: Linked lists do not require contiguous
// memory allocation, making them less prone to fragmentation and better suited
// for applications with unpredictable memory needs.
